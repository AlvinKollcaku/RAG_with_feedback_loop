    "answer": "Based on the provided context, there are tools available in Python to help find bugs or perform static analysis. The `doctest` module can be used to find examples in docstrings for a module and run them, comparing the output with the expected output given in the docstring. Additionally, the `unittest` module is a more advanced testing framework modeled on Java and Smalltalk testing frameworks. These tools can aid in bug detection and static analysis in Python programs.
